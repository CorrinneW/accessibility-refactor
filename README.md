accessibility code refactor assignment

## The Assignment

Update an existing web page to increase accessibility without altering the look of the website.

## What I Did

1. Added meaningful alt text to images where appropriate. Used empty alt attributes for decorative/nonessential images.
2. Ensured all links function properly
3. Updated HTML with semantic tags that properly describe each element.
4. Consolidated redundant CSS classes and organized CSS to follow the flow of the HTML document.
5. Added meaningful commenting to HTML and CSS to improve readability.
6. Tested accessibility using Narrator screen reader, dark mode and inverted colors.

## The Result

Same outside; new, more accessible inside.
